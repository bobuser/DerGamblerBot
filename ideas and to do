Ideas:
    - cronjob for daily free games
    - free games as first payment, then balance
    - bot only listens to users with valid payment (free_games / balance (score))
    - events: (1.5x wins [payed from bank_balance])

to do:
    - chat_data Jackpot in new list (bank)
        - Jackpot
        - bank's balance (percentage of gambled balance of players as fee)
    - initiate chat_data {bank} for saving
    - save chat_data {bank}
    - load chat_data {bank}


chat_data:
    {{users},
     |   | {user 1}
     |   |   | {user_id}
     |   |   | {user_name}
     |   |   | {user_balance}
     |   |   | {user_free_games}
     |   |
     |   | {user 2}...
     |
     {bank}}
     |   | {bank_balance}
     |   | {bank_jackpot}
